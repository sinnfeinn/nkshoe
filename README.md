## Hardware:\
- esp32 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14689)\
- IMU (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14686)\
- flexsensor (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14666)\
\
## Software:\
- ESP32:\
- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)\
- Websockets (https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets)\
- ArduinoJson (https://arduinojson.org/?utm_source=meta&utm_medium=library.properties)\
- SparkFun ADS1015 Arduino Library (https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ADS1015_Arduino_Library)\
- SparkFun BNO080 Arduino Library (https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BNO080_Arduino_Library)\
- NTPClient (https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient)</br>
\
## Web:\
- html/css</br>
- Three JS (https://www.threejs.org)\
- Moment JS (https://momentjs.com/)\
- Chart JS (https://www.chartjs.org/)\
- Chart Streaming Plugin (https://nagix.github.io/chartjs-plugin-streaming/)\
- Free stl show model (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/shoe-stl-8bc37802b11240f6bad3bb3b60e682ae#download)\
\
## Building instructions:\
\
1.) Install Arduino IDE and follow the instructions to setup the esp32 feather board:
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/using-with-arduino-ide
\
2.) Install all the required libraries from above. (Software/ESP32)
\
3.) Change the Wifi Credentials to your home wifi.
\
4.) Change the board definitions in Arduino IDE to adafruit esp32 feather and upload the sketch. (baud speed 921600/80/none)
\
5.) Open Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox with CORS disabled. (See: https://medium.com/@siddhartha.ng/disable-cross-origin-on-chrome-for-localhost-c644b131db19)
\
6.) Make sure you and the shoe are in the same Wifi network. 
\
7.) Open esp32shoe.html and change line 145 and 294 ( "ws = new WebSocket("ws://172.20.10.6/ws");" )to your esp32's wifi address 
\
8.) Download a free stl model of a shoe and place it in the ascii folder. (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/shoe-stl-8bc37802b11240f6bad3bb3b60e682ae) If its a different model rename it to SHOE_STL.stl or change line 132 in esp32shoe.html.
If the model is to small or too big change line 137 in esp32shoe.html.
\
9.) Open esp32shoe.html 
\
10.) Check developertools/network/ws for websocket connections.
\
11.) Enjoy.
\
\
## TODO:\
-- Reduce websocket connections from two to one.\
-- Work on flex accuracy.\
-- Reduce stl model to allower speedier movement.\
-- Much more.\
